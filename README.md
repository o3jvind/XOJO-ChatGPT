This is a modified version of “ChatGPTConnection Class” example included with XOJO. Like the original this example includes a class called ChatGPTConnection you can use to send a prompt to ChatGPT and get back a response. But unlike the original, here you get a streaming response from ChatGPT. This example also tries to show how you can “control" ChatGPT's response by defining an assistant. The prompt is just a plain text statement you wish to send as is the response.

To try the ChatGPTConnection class in this example project or use it in your own projects, you'll need a ChatGPT API key.  You can learn how to get an API key and more about the original ChatGPTConnection class in this blog post:
